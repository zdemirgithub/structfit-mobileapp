            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Our commitment to privacy</p>

It can be downloaded or deleted by you at any time (e.g. your workouts and activities). The only data we store remotely is you email. And this is only required if you choose to create an optional account with the Service. Accounts are used for the purposes of allowing you to sync your data with 3rd party services.</p>
            <h3>What information we collect</h3>
            <p>Your email is collected during the optional registration process.</p>

            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will delete such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
